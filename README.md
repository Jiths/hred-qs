# Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder-Decoder code (HRED) for Query Suggestion.

This code accompanies the paper:

"A Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder-Decoder For Generative Context-Aware Query Suggestion", by Alessandro Sordoni, Yoshua Bengio, Hossein Vahabi, Christina Lioma, Jakob G. Simonsen, Jian-Yun Nie, to appear in CIKM'15.

This code will be constantly cleaned and modified to reflect the changes in the paper until July 31th, when a final version of the code will be available.

The pre-print of the paper is available at: http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02221.
